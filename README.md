# Django app provisioning using Salt
Example Salt states for provisioning the infrastructure of a REST API implemented in Python with SQL persistence.

# Infrastructure

## DB
The DB used is PostgreSQL and runs in a single machine.

## REST API
The API runs on a single machine.

The API uses the database from the DB machine.

The API is configured as a WSGI application and executed by gunicorn.

The gunicorn instance is watched by the supervisor service.

Nginx runs as a reverse proxy of gunicorn.

## Salt
Salt runs on:

* A Salt master machine
* The REST API machine (running a Salt minion)
* The DB machine (running a Salt minion)


# Prerequisites
* Python 
* Ruby
* A VM Manager, either:
** VirtualBox or
** libvirt with vagrant-libvirt Vagrant plugin installed(vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt)
* Vagrant

# Initial VM Setup
The Vagrantfile already exist in this project. In order to create the VMs execute:

```bash
vagrant up
```

## Cleanup
When finished working on this project, execute:

```bash
vagrant destroy -f
```



# Salt

## Configuration

### Master
```file_roots``` is set to directory ```saltstack/salt``` and ```pillar_roots``` to ```saltstack/pillar```, both settings defined in ```saltstack/etc/master```

## Operation
Log into Salt master:
```bash
vagrant ssh master
```

Change to root user:
```bash
sudo su
```

Accept the keys of Salt minions:
```bash
salt-key -A
```

Provision all minions:
```bash
salt '*' state.apply
```


## Provision Walkthrough
All the actions described below are performed automatically by Salt during provision.


### API
The application code is cloned from a Github repository into a local directory.

The application relies on an ```.env``` file, which is filled with information read by Salt from Pillar and Mine.

Salt Pillar contains DB credentials.

Salt Mine provides the IP address of each machine, in particular the IP address of the DB server. Salt uses the DB IP address informed by Mine and fills the DB host parameter in the ```.env``` file.
